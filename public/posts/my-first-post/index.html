There is a moral and spiritual legacy of actions, events, teachings, and commandments that form a chronologically-experienced, cyclically-emergent continuum of responsibility overseen by God.</p><p>It is like being bequeathed a moral or spiritual &ldquo;estate&rdquo;; how you manage, respect, or neglect this inheritance impacts your current spiritual standing and future redemption or judgment. Our society acts like an ungrateful heir, squandering this rich inheritance on indulgent distractions and fleeting diversions. And in so doing, we mock and discard this legacy, turning our backs on the divine guidance that shaped civilizations.</p><p>The ontological view sees the Past as an accumulation process that shapes your existence in the Present (and potential in the Future). The Past, Present, and Future are not separate entities; they are interconnected aspects of time continually defining and redefining each other through the experience of being. There is an aggregation of experiences informing the essence of your current being.</p><p>It is like accumulating existential capital: this capital is not static, and it &ldquo;yields interest&rdquo; through the experiences and lessons that guide decisions and determine possibilities. The ontological view sees every experience, every choice, and every generation as contributing to the wealth of knowledge and understanding that defines the essence of our existence.</p><p>And from this view, we are just as reckless: obsessed with the new and the now, long-term investment is all but overshadowed by the universal desire for quick, superficial rewards.</p><h2 id=present>Present</h2><blockquote><p>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p></blockquote><p><strong>—Ecclesiastes 3:15</strong></p><blockquote><p>Temporality temporalizes as a future which makes present in the process of having been.</p></blockquote><p><strong>—Martin Heidegger, &ldquo;Being and Time&rdquo;</strong></p><p>In both views, the Present is the critical moment for action.</p><p>The theological view places moral responsibility for these actions under divine scrutiny. The ontological view places existential responsibility on these actions, whereby the Present is the stage for authentic living and the formation of the self. In neither is the Present a standalone moment, but rather a nexus for past influences and future potentials where our actions are not isolated but eternally resonant.</p><p>The Present is like a currency to be either expended or invested meaningfully towards the achievement of existential authenticity and spiritual fulfillment.</p><p>For us, the currency of the Present may as well be pearls before swine.</p><p>Our society has unfortunately normalized moral ambiguity and incentivized squandering this currency on hedonistic lifestyles, pet ideologies, and trivial pursuits (like &ldquo;equality,&rdquo; &ldquo;progress,&rdquo; &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; etc.), ignoring the looming consequences of betting the house on such ventures.</p><blockquote><p>BITCHES BORN IN THA 90&rsquo;S THATS UNDER 25 CAN&rsquo;T COOK CAN&rsquo;T CLEAN THEY DON&rsquo;T WANT TO WORK NOTHING. NIGGAZ THAT&rsquo;S 31 & OVER GET IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM & WONDER WHY SHIT AIN&rsquo;T WORKING THAT&rsquo;S BECAUSE ALL YOUNG BITCHES WANT TO DO IS POP PILLS, SMOKE WEED, GET DRUNK, LAY AROUND, SUCK DICK, EAT HOT CHEETOS, CHARGE THEY PHONE, GET A SEW IN WEAVE TWERK, BE BI SEXUAL, EAT MCDONALD&rsquo;S, WASH THEY PUSSY IN THA SINK, LIE TAKE SELFIES AND TALK SHIT THRU WIFI CUZ THEY PHONE NEVER ON.</p></blockquote><p>We live in an era defined by its deficit of meaning and purpose, and as a result, we are marching towards collapse with no (good) end in sight.</p><p>For us, the currency of the Present is a shitcoin—but still, I HODL.</p><div><a class=next href=https://kcdavidson.net/posts/my-second-post/>My Second Post</a></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;var t,e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,t="kcdavidson",e.src="//"+t+".disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a><div id=custom-substack-embed></div><script>window.CustomSubstackWidget={substackUrl:"kcdavidson.substack.com",placeholder:"Type your email...",buttonText:"Subscribe",theme:"custom",colors:{primary:"var(--color-primary)",input:"var(--color-background)",email:"var(--color-subtext)",text:"var(--color-text-bright)"}}</script><script src=https://substackapi.com/widget.js async></script></main></body><footer class=site-footer><p>هذا هو كفاحي</p><p>&copy; 2024
